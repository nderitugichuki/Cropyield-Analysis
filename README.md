# Cropyield-Analysis
## Overview

This project focuses on identifying the key factors that influence crop yields across various regions in the world. By analyzing historical data, we aim to uncover trends in crop production and understand the relationship between yields and factors such as rainfall patterns, pesticide usage, and temperature.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes historical data on crop yields from different regions in the world, along with associated factors that may influence these yields. The main features of the dataset include:

- **Area**: The specific country where the data was collected.
- **Item**: The type of crop for which the yield is recorded.
- **Year**: The year in which the data was recorded.
- **hg/ha_yield**: The crop yield measured in hectograms per hectare.
- **average_rain_fall_mm_per_year**: The average annual rainfall in millimeters for the region.
- **pesticides_tonnes**: The amount of pesticides used in tonnes.
- **avg_temp**: The average temperature in the region during the year.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

1. **Identify Factors Influencing Crop Yields**: Determine how various factors such as rainfall, pesticide usage, and temperature impact crop yields across different countries.
  
2. **Analyze Historical Trends**: Explore historical trends in crop production to understand how yields have changed over time and the possible reasons behind these changes.
  
3. **Correlate Factors with Yields**: Utilize basic statistical methods to explore correlations between crop yields and the influencing factors.

## Methods

To achieve the objectives, the following methods will be employed:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data, correcting errors, and normalizing the dataset for consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarizing the main characteristics of the data using visualizations and descriptive statistics.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Using statistical methods to examine relationships between crop yields and various factors.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying and visualizing trends in crop yields over time.

## Usage

This dataset can be used by researchers, agricultural scientists, and policymakers to:

- Understand the impact of environmental and management factors on crop yields.
- Make informed decisions on agricultural practices and policies.
- Develop models to predict future crop yields based on historical data.
